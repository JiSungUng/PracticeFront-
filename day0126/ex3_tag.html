    <p >이 노래는 it's about you baby<br>
Only you<br>
You, you, you<br>
You, you, you, you</p>

<p>내가 힘들 때, 울 것 같을 때<br>
기운도 이젠 나지 않을 때<br>
It's you 날 걱정하네<br>
It's you 날 웃게하네<br>
말 안 해도 돼<br>
Boy, what do you say?</p>

<p> 멀리든 언제든지 달려와<br>
(They keep on asking me, "Who is he?")<br>
바쁜 척도 없이 넌 나타나<br>
(They keep on asking me, "Who is he?")<br>
이게 말이 되니? 난 물어봐<br>
(They keep on asking me, "Who is he?")<br>
너는 말야<br>
He's the one that's living in my system, baby</p>


<p>Oh my, oh my God 예상했어 나<br>
I was really hoping that he will come through<br>
Oh my, oh my God 단 너뿐이야<br>
Asking all the time about what I should do</p>

<p style="background-color: yellow;">No, I can never let him go<br>
너만 생각나 twenty-four<br>
난 행운아야 정말로 I know, I know<br>
널 알기 전까지는 나 의미 없었어 전부 다<br>
내 맘이 끝이 없는 걸 I know, I know<br>
I'm going crazy, right?</p>
